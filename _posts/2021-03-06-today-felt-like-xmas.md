title: today felt like Christmas because
date: 2021-03-06

the birds’ fervent chirping and the soft, flowing wind and the kindness I gave my own reflection through the window of a parked car as I walked towards 31st street all made me feel like my 18 year self, a strange and almost unsettling calmness inside of me. because the lady at the post office gave me hot wheels stamps instead of American flags.

leaving the post office, I felt lighter knowing that all the letters and packages that had been piling up in my outbox were on their way to their next homes. I felt so airy I leapt all the way back to my apartment, my groceries swinging in easy tow. I’ve been exchanging analog letters with a few folks these past few months: an old coworker from my time on Ohlone land teaching with Am*** corps back in 2016 – who has a child now!!!; a few ongoing pen pals or one-off requests to send articles/other lit to incarcerated folks inside; and my loves scattered all over turtle island. Letter-writing has been such a vehicle of love for years, and I feel so much happiness from these exchanges! I always thought those “love letters for strangers” projects were so lovely too. E leaves treasures around the city still, sort of like geocaching I suppose – I’ve never done it! though I don’t have much of a good impression, considering my first interaction was during this research gig in high school at Notre Dame, where all the white kids geocached in the campus cemetery, which felt both disrespectful and unpleasant….
 
I woke up this morning full of light. As an adult, without any particular holiday traditions or rituals to celebrate/share in, Christmas hasn’t felt too different from any other day of the year – though I’ve come to appreciate any excuse to send tiny and thoughtful messages to people. I love u. I hope ur eating well. I thought of u today. I miss u.
