As I've migrated further and further away from social media, I've been looking for other containers to organize, store, and share ideas, threads, happenings, etc. An old middle school friend introduced me to the idea of digital gardens a few years ago! While this is not quite what I'd like it to be, while i figure out jekyll and git, i hope its content and shape will grow
